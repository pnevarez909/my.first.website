<p1>Scracth is a drop and go programming language that taugh me that programming isn't as complicated as it looks. it shows me that HTML5 is just like scratch, except instead of having functions to dorp we type the same function over and over.This game was a success when we made it. it worked fine and pleased our customer. My coding knowldege grew immensely from this game i made. It became easy for me to code on scrathc and taught me that coding does not have to be hard, you just have to learn the functions and when to put/type them in. </p1>
